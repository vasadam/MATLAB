%%%   The Barotropic Vorticity Equation is approximated %%%
%%%   by centered finite differences. The domain has    %%%
%%%   M * N points.                                     %%%
%%%                                                     %%%
%%%   The boundary conditions are as described          %%%
%%%   in the Tellus paper: z is given on the boundary   %%%
%%%   and vorticity (xi) is given at inflow points.     %%%
%%%                                                     %%%
%%%   The time scheme is the leapfrog method.           %%%
%%%   (the first step is a forward step).               %%%
%%%                                                     %%%
%%%   The quantity to be stepped forward is             %%%
%%%                xi = Del^2(z)                        %%%
%%%   Thus, after each time-step, it is necessary       %%%
%%%   to solve a Poisson equation to get z.             %%%
%%%   This is done by the Fourier Transform method,     %%%
%%%   as in the Tellus paper. (For a description of     %%%
%%%   the method, see Numerical Recipes Sec. 19.4.)     %%%
%%%                                                     %%%
%%%   A variety of initial conditions may be specified  %%%
%%%   determined by the parameter Ncase (see below).    %%%
